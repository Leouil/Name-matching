# Fuzzy Name-matching
Name matching algorithm for company and people name in English

coname.py will match two sets of Company names in English. The pre-defined company name pattern is for U.S firms, such as Inc, Corp etc..
This algorithm (henceforth "the algo") will allow ONE set of names have uninformative words for counter the extraction errors. For example, suppose you extract some firm names from some texts. Suppose you cannot identify the exact location of the name and extracted "In the case of Microsoft Corp" instead of "Microsoft Corp", algo is robust to such noice. But you should do your best to obtain clean names to improve accuracy.

Now, I explain the logic behind the algo. First, I recover the common abbreviations used in the names. Currently, the default for U.S firms such as "inc" (incorporation), "corp" (corporation), or "intl" (international). The list I populate is from manually reading the compustat database. If you have your own list of abbreviations, please edit in your local branch for your own usage. Next, I will run the token_set_ratio from fuzzywuzzy.fuzz module between two names. This will be the raw score to start with. token_set_ratio does not care about the order the name e.g "United Airline" will matched to "Aireline United". It does not care about additional words e.g. "In the case of Microsoft Corp" will be matched to "Microsoft Corp". In other words, as long as two names are reasonable subset of one of another, the pair will remain in the sample. The beauty of using token_set_ratio is it will give you all the possible matches (with all possible reporting mistakes). I require the score to be more than 60 to remain in the sample. It is highly unlikely that score below 60 will constitute a possible match.

Next, we enforce two things for the match. First, I enforce the order of the matched words to be in the same order. Note that the "matched" word does not have to be exact match i.e. "technology" will matched to "technologu" to account for misspelling.
